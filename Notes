For tailing an infinite list, using a bit of a hack
13:03 <aavogt> but maybe            > do t <- forkIO (do { computation `seq` 
  putMVar v computation });  threadDelay 123; e <- tryTakeMVar v; when 
  (isNothing e) (killThread t)

13:00 <quicksilver> osfameron: I would model it explicitly rather than trying 
                    to 'hack into' the underlying lazy evaluation.
13:01 <quicksilver> osfameron: e.g. an explicit queue of work and well 
                    understood ways to access the currently completed jobs.

12:25 <amcewen> osfameron: have you seen http://www.spark-project.org/ - 
                "Hadoop-alike in Scala"
